- A telephone directory and its content may be known by the colour of the paper it is printed on.

        White pages generally indicates personal or alphabetic listings.
        Yellow pages, golden pages, A2Z, or classified directory is usually a "business directory", where businesses are
        listed alphabetically within each of many classifications (e.g., "lawyers"), almost always with paid advertising.
        Grey pages, sometimes called a "reverse telephone directory", allowing subscriber details to be found for a
        given number. Not available in all jurisdictions. (These listings are often published separately, in a city
        directory, or under another name, for a price, and made available to commercial and government agencies.)
         Business Listing Sites like JustBaazaar, JustDial, IndiaMart, Hotfrog, are nowadays very important to increase
         online presence. Most of these websites offer a free business listing.

    Other colors may have other meanings; for example, information on government agencies is often printed on blue pages
    or green pages.[citation needed]
- A reverse telephone directory is sorted by number, which can be looked up to give the name and address of the subscriber.
